    documentation="Breathe. Hold this position at the top, or do repetitions. The goal is to feel your glutes and abdominals tightening and working together to open and stretch the front of your hips. &#xD;&#xA;Come up as high as you feel comfortable. Breathe. You may feel a stretch in the front of your hips. This is good. Come back down and perform repetitions, holding at the top until you can feel that you've fatigued your glutes. Breathe. &#xD;&#xA;I do not assign numbers for sets and reps because I don't know your baseline level (everybody is different). You want to stress the tissues so that your body will respond by making changes to them."/>
