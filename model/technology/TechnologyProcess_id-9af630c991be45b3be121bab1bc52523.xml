    documentation="Engage your Glutes (buttocks muscles) to come into full Bridge: Squeeze your glutes (crack the walnut) to lift your pelvis completely off the ground as you begin to “bridge” up. Do not arch your lower back. &#xD;&#xA;Your abdominals and glutes are now working together as a force couple to lift your pubic bone to the sky.&#xD;&#xA;Even though your glutes are now involved, maintain your abdominal engagement throughout"/>
