    documentation="Feel the areas of your trunk that are most connected with the ground (major support zones). They are likely your upper back and pelvis. This is important to feel because weâ€™re going to shift your connection away from these 2&#xD;&#xA;areas and into your Back Anchor Zone, which is identified as the bottom of your rib cage in the back. You will connect this area by pushing into the ground with it."/>
